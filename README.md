# AirQuality
This repository stores some scripts that examine air quality issues. The contents are focused on Texas in general, and Houston specifically.

Important caveats: 1) I don't know how to Github (probably because) 2) I'm self taught 3) Issues 1 & 2 might result in some expected components not being in place.
